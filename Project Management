Process Groups: Projetc Management Life Cycle:
Initiating -> 
Defining the Project
Assess scope
Determine resources needed
Identify stakeholders
Ask for approval
Planning-> 
What are we going to do?
How are we going to do it?
How will we know when its done?

Project Management Approaches:
1. Traditional approach (Waterfall):
Works well when goals are clearly defined
Simplicity
low risk
Familiar tech
Experienced resources

Agile Approach:
Iterations produce deliverables at regualr intervals
value delivered sooner
more customer involveemnt
smaller independent teams

Org structure affectes projects:
Hierarchy: CEO <- Functional manager <- Staff
Matrix: CEO <- Functional manager <- Staff 
OR CEO <- Functional manager <- Project Manager <- Staff (from diff Funcational managers)
Projectized: CEO <- Project Manager <- Staff

Hierarchy:
PM has almost no authority
Functional manager in charge of budget
Resources do not report to PM
PM has divided responsibilities

Matrix:
Weak/Balanced/Strong
PM has some authority
Resources report to two managers
PM and staff work full time on projects

Projectized:
PM has almost complete authority
resources are dedicated to proj
PM and admin staff work full time

Org culture affects Projects
Shaping culture:
Mission statement
Leadership
Work environment
Navigating culture:
Know the boundaries
Respect change management
Respect local culture

INITIATE THE PROJECT:
Assign a PM, Prepare the Project chrter

Stakeholders:
Customer
Proj sponsor
Dept
Team members
- need to know what they expect 

Project customer - Person or group with a problem to solver
Funds the project
Informs what needs to be done
Approves deliverables
eg CEO for Scheduling

Project Sponsor-
wants project to succeed
eg. COO
Prioritize objectives
Talk to stakeholders
suggest improvements

Funcational Managers:
Achieve dept goals
Manager team members

Team Mambers
Departments: Invested and affected by project outcomes


ANALYZE STAKEHOLDERS:
Stakeholder Analysis
Name, Dept/Company, Position, Advisers, Objectives/Requirements.Interests, Influence, Project Contribution, Resistance
First determine
Dept/Company -> Position -> Advisers (who they report to) -> Objs/Prioritize -> Influence/interest in the project -> project Contribution (what to expect from them) -> Resistance

PROJECT GOAL:
Defines the end results
Solves the problem
takes advantage of opportunity

Problem Statement:
Clearly defines the problem or opportunity
(dont want to jump directly to solution)
Why do we need a new .....?
Ask why more then once
Problem statement could be: Hospital Resources arent being utilized effectively, because scheduling doesnt ensure that the necessary equipment, staff, and facilities are available. Funding is available to address scheduling issues
Project Goal: The project will deliver scheduling improvements so hospital resurces can be scheduled efficiently. The project will take advantage of funding available for productivity and technology enhancements.

Measurable Objectives-
Show how much has been achieved
Quantitative or Qualitative (Survey responses)
Achievable objectives-
Tell what can be done with resources available
Time-Related objectives-
Identify when objectives need to be achieved

Goals and Objetives done -> Benefit analysis with stakeholders

Project Objectives:
Specific
Measurable
Achievable
Realistsic
Tme-related


CHOOSE A STRATEGY:
1. Brainstorming - group 
Identify possible strategies
Allow free flow of ideas
Avoid evaluation
Strategy Decision Matrix helps to evaluate the options
Q1 Does the strategy meet the required objectives?
Q2 How likely is the strategy to meet the other objectives? (Weighing for importance)

From the top strategy from decision matrix:
Group then asks
1. Is the startegy feasible? (Feasibility study)
2. Are the risks acceptable? (Risk analysis)
3. Does strategy fit the culture?

GATHER REQUIREMENTS:
Requiremnts challenges-
incorrect requirements
Inconsistent
Missing
Unnessary
Customers dont commit time

Requirements gathering techniques:
Interviews - right people
Focus groups - brainstorming from each group to discuss the requirements 
Observation
Surveys
Analyze existing documents
Analyze requirements:
Clarify with stakeholders
Documenting Requirements
- Clear
- Concise
- Organized
Developing Requiremets

DELIVERABLES AND SUCCESS CRITERIA:
Deliverables are measured by success criteria
Deliverables:

WORK BREAKSOWN STRUCTURE (WBS):
Easier to estimate time and cost
Scheduling Project
---Redesign processes (4 Mo)
- Business Process Analysis (1.5 Mo)
- Design Processes (2.5 Mo)
--- New System (6 Mo)
-- System Spcification (2 Mo)
- Build Specs (2 Mo)
- Review Specs (2 Wk)
- Approve Specs
-- Signed Contract (1 Mo)
- Obtain proposal (2 Wk)
- Select Vendor (1 Wk)
- Negotiate Teams (1 Wk)
- Sign Contract
-- Implement System (3 Mo)
- Design/Config (1.5 Mo plan)
- Configure Server (2 Wk)
- Load Database (2 Wk)
- Install on Deices (2 Wk)
--- Documentation
- Prepare Draft (1 Mo)
- Review (2 Wk)
- Revise (1 Wk)
- Publish (1 Wk)
--- Training (2 Mo)
- Preparing Training (1 Mo)
- Schedule Training (2 Wk)
- Deliver Training (1 Mo)

Easier to assign tasks to teamwork
WBS contains 2 tasks:
Summary Tasks: High-level tasks in WBS
Work Packages: Lowest level in WBS

BUILD WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE:
Brainstom initial WBS in group
Project In-Scope can help in developing Summary tasks
now breakdown summary tasks into smaller pieces and then agai in small chuncks
Work Packages: Break down in eight-to-eighty hour tasks (lowest level tasks in WBS)
Match to frequenyc of status report

Determining Breakdowns:
Time and cost are easy to estimate
Status is easy to measure
Task durations are shorter than reporting periods
details are amangeable

DEINING WORK PACKAGES:
Level of detail:
Familiarity of work
Experience of the team member

ESTIMATE TIME AND COST:
Core planning team - initially
Team members - ongoing

Estimates +-75% (initially)
Estimates +-10% (ongoing)

Parametric Model: (You calculate work and cost based on a measured unit) (but require many similar data from prev projects)
Delphi Technique: (ask several experts individually for estimates) (share results with group keeping the estimates anonymous) (ask eveyone to esimate again and repeat and then finally average is the estimate)
Top-Down: Estimate phases or major components and break those estimates into smaller pieces until you get to individual tasks
Bottom-Up: Estimating each tasks and then add them up to get the estimate of the entire projects

CHOOSE THE BEST ESTIMATE:
Best Case - 30 min
Typical - 45 min
Worst Case - 60 min
Bell curve - Normal distribution
50% of possible values are less than the average and 50% are more then the average
that means we cannot use the average value as it gives 50%-50% chance
Dont use the worst-case estimate as it gives teh highest chance of success
Dont use the Best-Case estimate

86% Probability - Good chance for success
Adjust your estimate:
-A higher value increase the chnace of success - No
-A lower value decreases the chance of success - No
- Choose the estimate with an acceptable probability of success

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN:
- Roles
- Responsibilities
- Reporting structure
- Skills
- Staffing

Responsibility Matrix:
RICA
Responsible for doing
Needs to be Informed
Consult before a decision
Accountable for decisions and delegations
